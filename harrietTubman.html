                <h1>Harriet Tubman</h1>
                <h2>March 6, 1822, Dorchester County, MD</h2>
                <h3>By Cajoh Thomas</h3>

                <p>I admire Harriet Tubman for her <b>bravery.</b> She had the bravery to escape slavery even though she knew that if they caught her she could end up dead. She made it to the north all by herself.  After she escaped to the north instead of just staying there as a free woman she went back down to the south and got her family. That's the bravest thing I ever heard but she didn't even stop there she went back many times bringing 300 slaves to freedom. She did all this with a giant bounty for her dead or alive.</p>
                <p>Harriet Tubman has many contributions to society. She was enslaved, escaped, and helped 300 slaves gain their <b>freedom.</b> Harriet was also a conductor of the Underground Railroad. Harriet was also a spy and she would wander the streets under confederate control and learn from the slaves about confederate troop placements and supply lines. Tubman helped many of these slaves find food, shelter, and even jobs in the North.  Harriet also served as a scout, guerrilla soldier, and nurse for the Union Army during the civil war. She is considered the <b>first</b> African American woman to serve in the military. </p>
